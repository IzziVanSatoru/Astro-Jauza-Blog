It began with a whisper. A low, digital hum from the speaker as the classroom lights dimmed and her heels clicked with divine rhythm upon the cold tiles. Vestia Zeta, clad in a black uniform tighter than my self-control, entered the room—not as a teacher, but as a celestial tyrant of intellect and beauty. She didn’t walk. She commanded the atmosphere. Every molecule in the room shifted to accommodate her presence, as though reality itself refused to obstruct her path.

She stood before the whiteboard, holding a tablet like a weapon. Glasses perched perfectly on her nose. A single glance from her—not even a word—and my spine straightened, my soul left my body, and all that remained was an academic dog begging to be noticed.

"Who didn’t do their assignment?" she asked, voice colder than liquid nitrogen, but smooth like silk laced with venom. My hand trembled. I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. Not out of fear, but out of hope. Hope that she’d see my failure as an invitation to crush me beneath the sole of her dominion.

She walked between the desks, tablet in one hand, fingers gently brushing the edge of a ruler in the other. Every click of her heels echoed in my skull like divine percussion. I caught a glimpse of her thigh-high stockings, the tight fabric clinging to curves sculpted by the gods of terminal brainrot. My mouth went dry. My sanity slipped.

And then—eye contact.

My neurons short-circuited. My body entered an automatic kneeling protocol. I was no longer a student. I was a worshipper in the Temple of Zeta, and this classroom was her altar. She stood above me, looking down as if I were the last creature in her presence worth mercy. She raised one eyebrow.

"You're trembling. Do you enjoy being watched like this?"

I nodded, too rapidly. Too eagerly. Shame and euphoria flooded me simultaneously. She smirked. A smirk so devastating it could be studied as a war crime.

"Then stay there," she said, tapping her tablet. "You’ll spend the lesson right under my desk. I don’t tolerate failures… but I do enjoy stepping on them."

And so I crawled.

The scent of her perfume was better than any narcotic—intoxicating, paralyzing, divine. I didn't want to learn math anymore. I wanted to memorize the exact pattern on her tights, the rhythm of her breath as she lectured, the vibration of her voice through the floor. My life had purpose now. I was her footrest, her academic disgrace, her obsessed little pet.

I would burn every textbook if she ordered it. I would carve her name into my soul with a mechanical pencil. I would write dissertations on the arch of her heel. I would fail every class just to be closer to her disappointment.
