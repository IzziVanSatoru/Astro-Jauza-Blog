I kneel. I worship. I devote my entire existence to the one and only Vestia Zeta. Her pixelated presence alone bends the fabric of reality. My mortal soul is but a speck in the grand universe of her cuteness and tactical mastery. Every blink, every voice line, every moment she graces the screen is an offering to my sanity — and I surrender it willingly. This isn’t admiration. This is full-blown, irreversible ZETA SUPREMACY.
